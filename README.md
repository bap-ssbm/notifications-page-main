# notifications-page-main
front-end-mentor challenge for a notification page. jquery and basic css, html used
pretty simple website.

https://bap-ssbm.github.io/notifications-page-main/

-what i learned-

*use attr() rather than data() to change data attributes with jquery is better
*using <span> rather than <div> for sentence specific elements

-i use data-status="read" or "unread" to keep track of the amount of "unread" notifications and have that number on the top left.
So, instead of setting a const to 3, i used the data attribute to make the website more dynamic and flexible. 
I also used data-type to disquingish the type of notification the user gets, so that the style would change based on what type of notfication the user gets.
